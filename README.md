# ðŸ”‹ Energy Consumption Analysis â€“ Predictive Modeling & Seasonal Trends  

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview  
This project analyzes **building energy consumption patterns** using statistical modeling, correlation studies, and seasonal trend analysis.  
The goals are to:  
- Predict monthly energy usage from building characteristics.  
- Assess the impact of seasonal variations (summer vs. winter) on energy demand.  
- Identify key factors influencing consumption.  
- Forecast future energy usage patterns.

## ðŸ“Š Key Insights  
1. **Prediction Accuracy** â€“ GLM with Lasso achieved RÂ² = 0.9991 and RMSE = 19,623.  
2. **Top Predictors** â€“ Total annual KWH, peak month usage (January & June), and occupancy percentage.  
3. **Seasonal Impact** â€“ Summer shows highest variability due to cooling demand; winter usage driven by heating.  
4. **Occupancy Correlation** â€“ Weak positive correlation (0.22) between occupancy and energy usage.  
5. **Forecast Trends** â€“ ETS model predicts stable summer usage and higher winter uncertainty.

## ðŸ›  Methodology  
- **Data Cleaning** â€“ Removed irrelevant features, handled outliers, converted categorical data.  
- **Predictive Modeling** â€“ GLM with L1 regularization (Lasso) for feature selection.  
- **Statistical Testing** â€“ Spearman correlation & Kruskal-Wallis seasonal comparisons.  
- **Forecasting** â€“ ETS model for time series predictions.
